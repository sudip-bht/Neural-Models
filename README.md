# Neural-Models: Algorithms for Cancer Detection
Welcome to the Neural-Models repository! This project focuses on utilizing advanced neural models and algorithms for cancer detection.

# Models
  We are employing the following neural network models:

  Inception-v3
  Inception-v4
  YOLO-v8
  Dataset
  We are using the HAM10000 dataset, which has been augmented to ensure a balanced dataset for training and testing.

# Interface
  Frontend
  React Native: For building a user-friendly and intuitive mobile application interface.
  Backend
  Flask: To serve as the backend framework, handling requests and managing the flow of data between the front end and the models.
